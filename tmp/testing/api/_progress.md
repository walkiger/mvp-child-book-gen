# API Testing Progress

## Overview
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Progress**: 85%
- **Last Updated**: 2024-03-21
- **Updated By**: Testing Team

## Changes Since Last Update

### Completed
- ✅ Authentication endpoints test suite
- ✅ Story generation API tests
- ✅ Character creation endpoint tests
- ✅ Rate limiting test implementation
- ✅ Basic error handling tests

### In Progress
- 🔄 Image generation API tests (80%)
- 🔄 Cost tracking endpoint tests (60%)
- 🔄 Advanced error scenarios (75%)

### Blocked
- ⚠️ Concurrent user simulation tests (waiting for load testing infrastructure)
- ⚠️ Extended rate limit tests (needs rate limit policy finalization)

## Coverage Metrics

### Endpoint Coverage
- Authentication: 95%
- Story Generation: 90%
- Character Creation: 92%
- Image Generation: 80%
- Cost Tracking: 75%

### Test Types
- Unit Tests: 90%
- Integration Tests: 85%
- Load Tests: 70%
- Security Tests: 80%

## Performance Metrics
- Average Response Time: 250ms
- 95th Percentile: 500ms
- Error Rate: 0.5%
- Rate Limit Tests: 95% passing

## Next Steps
1. Complete image generation API tests
2. Implement remaining cost tracking tests
3. Add more edge case scenarios
4. Improve load testing coverage
5. Document remaining test gaps

## Notes
- Need to improve test isolation for story generation tests
- Consider adding more negative test cases
- Update rate limit test configurations
- Review test data management approach
