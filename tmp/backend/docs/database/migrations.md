# Database Migrations Documentation

## Overview
The database migrations system provides a robust way to manage database schema changes, with support for versioning, rollbacks, and transaction safety. It uses SQLAlchemy for migrations and includes utilities for creating and running migrations.

## Components

### Migration Management
Core migration functionality:

```python
def run_migrations():
    """Run all pending migrations with:
    - Transaction safety
    - Version tracking
    - Error handling
    - Rollback support
    """
```

### Migration Creation
Utilities for creating new migrations:

```python
def create_migration_script():
    """Create a new migration script with:
    - Timestamp-based naming
    - Template generation
    - Upgrade/downgrade functions
    """
```

### Migration Structure
Standard migration template:

```python
"""
Migration script template
"""
from sqlalchemy import text

def upgrade(engine):
    """Upgrade database schema."""
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        # Schema changes
        conn.execute(text("..."))
        conn.commit()

def downgrade(engine):
    """Downgrade database schema."""
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        # Rollback changes
        conn.execute(text("..."))
        conn.commit()
```

## Error Handling

### Error Classes
- `MigrationError`: Base migration error
  - Version tracking errors
  - Script loading errors
  - Execution failures
- `TransactionError`: Transaction issues
  - Commit failures
  - Rollback errors
- `SchemaError`: Schema-related issues
  - Invalid changes
  - Constraint errors

### Error Patterns
```python
try:
    # Run migrations
    run_migrations()
except MigrationError as e:
    # Handle migration failure
    # Log error details
    # Implement recovery
except TransactionError as e:
    # Handle transaction issues
    # Ensure rollback
    # Check data integrity
```

## Best Practices

1. **Migration Design**
   - Make changes atomic
   - Support rollbacks
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document changes

2. **Version Control**
   - Use timestamps
   - Track versions
   - Maintain history
   - Handle conflicts

3. **Data Safety**
   - Backup before migrating
   - Use transactions
   - Validate changes
   - Handle errors

## Integration Points
- SQLAlchemy Engine
- Version Tracking
- Error Handling
- Logging System

## Testing Requirements

1. **Migration Testing**
   - Test upgrades
   - Test downgrades
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check constraints

2. **Error Handling**
   - Test failure scenarios
   - Verify rollbacks
   - Check error reporting
   - Test recovery

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with models
   - Verify relationships
   - Check constraints
   - Test transactions

## Future Improvements

1. **Short-term**
   - Migration dry-run
   - Better error reporting
   - Progress tracking
   - Dependency checking

2. **Long-term**
   - Data migration tools
   - Schema validation
   - Migration dependencies
   - Automated testing
