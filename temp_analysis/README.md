## Current Test Status

The test suite has been significantly improved:
- 50 tests are now passing, including:
  - 36 command tests
  - 5 config tests
  - 9 API tests (including all auth tests)

Remaining issues:
- Character and Story API tests are still failing (401 Unauthorized)
- Tests that require database setup and mocking are failing
- Some endpoint tests are failing with 405 Method Not Allowed
- Pydantic deprecation warnings for class-based `config` (will be removed in V3.0)

## Development Workflow Improvements

The project now includes several improvements to streamline the development workflow:

### Unified Terminal Mode
- Command: `python manage.py start --unified-mode`
- Runs both backend and frontend servers in a single terminal
- Color-coded output (backend in blue, frontend in green)
- Threaded process management with proper error handling
- Simplified keyboard interrupt handling (Ctrl+C stops both servers)
- Improved error reporting for npm/Node.js issues

### Web Dashboard
- Command: `python manage.py dashboard`
- Lightweight Flask-based web interface for server management
- Features:
  - Server status monitoring (running status, PIDs, ports)
  - Start/stop controls for individual servers or both
  - Direct links to backend API and frontend app
  - System information display (Python version, Node version, OS)
  - Clean, responsive interface
- No WebSockets or complex dependencies required
- Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies

### IDE Terminal Integration
- Command: `python manage.py start --use-ide-terminal`
- Shows clearly formatted commands for copy/paste into separate IDE terminals
- Improved formatting for better visibility
- Works across all platforms and IDE environments

These improvements provide developers with multiple options for managing their development environment based on personal preferences and workflow requirements.

## Monitoring System

The project includes a comprehensive monitoring and management system for tracking and controlling both backend and frontend servers:

### Current Features
- Web dashboard for server management (`python manage.py dashboard`)
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Server health checks with response time tracking
- Log analysis with error/warning counts
- Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals
- JSON report generation with timestamped files
- Unified terminal view with color-coded outputs

### CLI Interface
```bash
# Generate a single monitoring report
python -m management monitor

# Save the report to a file
python -m management monitor --save

# Run continuous monitoring
python -m management monitor --continuous --interval 30

# Run monitoring for a specific duration
python -m management monitor --continuous --duration 3600

# Start web dashboard on custom port
python manage.py dashboard --port 3001
```

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Web Dashboard**
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets
   - Expanded system metrics tracking
   - Log file viewing and searching
   - Multiple dashboard themes

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - API route health checks
   - Client-side performance metrics
   - Database query performance tracking
   - User experience monitoring

3. **Alert System**
   - Email notifications for critical issues
   - Webhook integration for external tools
   - Configurable alert thresholds
   - Alert history and response tracking

4. **Automated Recovery**
   - Self-healing capabilities for common issues
   - Automatic server restart on critical failures
   - Circuit breakers for external dependencies
   - Automated log rotation and cleanup

These improvements will enhance the system's observability and provide better tools for maintaining application health and performance.
