# Components That Need Further Review

## ✅ Already Addressed

1. `.env` file
   - Review for sensitive information (note: already contains API key)
   - Check if all necessary configuration variables are included
   - **Status**: Configuration loading is working correctly

2. Database Utilities
   - ✅ Database initialization and migration process has been implemented
   - ✅ Created a dedicated `db_utils.py` module with proper logging
   - **Status**: COMPLETED

3. Database Version Control
   - ✅ `.gitignore` updated to exclude database files
   - ✅ `storybook.db` removed from Git tracking with `git rm --cached`
   - **Status**: COMPLETED

4. Testing Coverage
   - ✅ Comprehensive test suite for the application
   - ✅ Tests covering API, models, server utils, database utils, etc.
   - **Status**: COMPLETED
   - **Note**: Test suite contains tests for core functionality, API endpoints, and database models

5. Process Detection in `server_utils.py`
   - ✅ Simplified process detection to focus on most reliable methods per platform
   - ✅ Reduced fallback mechanisms while maintaining reliability
   - ✅ Improved handling of marker PIDs for Windows external processes
   - **Status**: COMPLETED

## Backend

1. Standalone Scripts
   - **Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ **Integrated scripts**:
     - `setup_project_env.py`: Integrated as `setup-project` command
     - `manage_env.py`: Integrated as `env` subcommand with `setup` and `show` options
     - `integrate_existing_migrations.py`: Integrated as `integrate-migrations` command
   - **Analysis**:
     - All standalone scripts have been consolidated into the management package
     - Each script's functionality is now available as a command in `manage.py`
     - Error handling framework has been applied to all commands
   - **Priority**: COMPLETED
   - **Approach Taken**:
     - Added new commands to `manage.py` for each script's functionality
     - Moved implementation into appropriate modules in the management package
     - Applied the error handling framework with context-based decorators

2. Error Handling Consistency
   - **Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Shared error handling framework implemented:
     - ✅ Standardized error class hierarchy with `BaseError` and specialized subclasses
     - ✅ Decorator-based error handling with `@with_error_handling`
     - ✅ Severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
     - ✅ Consistent error formatting with error codes
     - ✅ Recovery mechanisms including retries and circuit breakers
   - ✅ Management package integration:
     - ✅ Updated to use the shared error handling utilities
     - ✅ Specialized `ProcessError` class for management-specific errors
     - ✅ Consistent application of error handling decorators
   - ✅ Comprehensive test suite:
     - ✅ 24 dedicated tests across three test files
     - ✅ All tests passing with good coverage

## Frontend

1. Overall structure
   - Need to review app architecture
   - Check component organization
   - **Priority**: LOW (outside current focus)
